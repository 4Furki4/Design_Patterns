# Creational Design Patterns

Creative design patterns offer general suggestions on how to create software objects, and create the necessary objects depending on the predetermined situations, thanks to the flexible structure it uses. Creative patterns are design patterns that allow the system to call the appropriate object without tracking which object should be called. It adds noticeable flexibility to the application where objects need to be created. The main purpose is that good software should be designed independently of how the objects it contains are created.

Creative patterns consist of objects that need to be created during the working process of the application and five different templates (patterns) that envisage the creation of these objects within certain structures.
