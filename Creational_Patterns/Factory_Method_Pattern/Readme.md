 # What is Factory Method Design Pattern?
 It is a creative design pattern that basically separates the interface and object creation functions by leaving the object creation to subclasses and using a single interface for object creation.

 If we say what the Factory Design Pattern solves, you can think of it like this when I will produce objects from more than one relational class. You may need different types of objects at certain steps in your algorithm. You can create these objects via if â€“ else or switch structures, depending on the situation. Of course, it cannot be thought that doing this every time is very time and code-saving. Instead of requesting an object from the class I want to create, we can produce the required object over a single instance with the Factory Pattern.

# How is it applied?

- All subclasses must inherit from the same parent class. [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/Design_Patterns/blob/master/Creational_Patterns/Factory_Method_Pattern/LAB/Interface/IFurniture.cs)

- I created my subclass by implementing it from my "IFurniture" interface. [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/Design_Patterns/blob/master/Creational_Patterns/Factory_Method_Pattern/LAB/Concrete/Cupboard.cs)
 
- To implement the factory pattern, I defined a factory method in the "FurnitureCreator" class, the return type of the method should be the parent class. [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/Design_Patterns/blob/master/Creational_Patterns/Factory_Method_Pattern/LAB/FurnitureCreator.cs)

- We need to allow subclasses to create an object based on the parameter passed to the factory method. [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/oguzhanKomcu/Design_Patterns/blob/master/Creational_Patterns/Factory_Method_Pattern/Program.cs)
