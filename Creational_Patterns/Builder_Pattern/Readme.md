# WHAT IS Builder Design Pattern ?

We can solve the issues with large number of parameters by providing a constructor with required parameters and then different setter methods to set the optional parameters. The problem with this approach is that the Object state will be inconsistent until unless all the attributes are set explicitly.

Builder pattern solves the issue with large number of optional parameters and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step and provide a method that will actually return the final Object.

# Advantage of Builder Design Pattern

The main advantages of Builder Pattern are as follows:

- It provides clear separation between the construction and representation of an object.
- It provides better control over construction process.
- It supports to change the internal representation of objects.
