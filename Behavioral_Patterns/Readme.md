## What is Behavioral Design Pattern?
According to Wikipedia, in Software Engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

The Behavioral Design Patterns deal with the communication or interaction between Classes and objects. The interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they are talking to each other and still are loosely coupled. The loose coupling is the key to n-tier architecture.

So, a behavioral pattern explains how objects interact. It describes how different objects and classes send messages to each other to make things happen and how the steps of a task are divided among different objects.

## When to use Behavioral Design Patterns ? 

In real-time applications, sometimes we want to change the behavior of a class and again we donâ€™t want it to affect other classes of the project. For example, we have an Invoice class that currently applying taxes as 18%. Tomorrow if we want to add another extra tax. That means we are changing the behavior of a class. To solve such types of Behavioral issues Behavioral Design Pattern comes into the picture.
