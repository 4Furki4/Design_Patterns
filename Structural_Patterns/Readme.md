Structural Patterns describe how objects and classes can be combined to form larger structures without compromising the flexibility and efficiency of the structure.In accordance with the class and object structure in the C# programming language, structural patterns are divided into two as class structure patterns and object structure patterns. Class structure patterns extend structures in software projects by combining class interfaces or applications using inheritance, which is one of the four basic elements of object-oriented programming. Object structure patterns, on the other hand, help users to combine these objects to create new objects so that the objects gain functions other than their own. Structural patterns are also divided into seven to be used in various situations that software engineers need in their projects where they are developing applications. Structural patterns can be used in the design phases of software projects or in the extension phases of these projects. Basically, although some of these molds are only customized to be used in the initial stages of projects, all design molds belonging to the structural molds group can work as an alternative to each other, depending on the place where they will be used and the status of the projects.
